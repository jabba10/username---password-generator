It effectively neutralizes the threat posed by stolen passwords, making it an essential practice for protecting email, financial, social media, and any other sensitive accounts.</p><p>In today&#x27;s threat landscape, relying solely on a password is like locking your door but leaving a window wide open; MFA closes and bolts that window, providing the comprehensive security everyone needs.</p></div></div></div></section><section class="multifactors_mfaTypesSection__3iwi3"><div class="multifactors_sectionHeader__UHBKK"><h2>Types of Multi-Factor Authentication</h2><p class="multifactors_sectionSubtitle__CVfdg">Different methods of MFA and their security levels</p></div><div class="multifactors_mfaTypesGrid__6C1EL"><div class="multifactors_mfaTypeCard__D4t3X"><div class="multifactors_mfaIcon__sRc83">🔑</div><h3>Hardware Security Keys</h3><p>Physical devices like YubiKey that use FIDO2/WebAuthn standards for phishing-resistant authentication.</p><span class="multifactors_mfaSecurityLevel__DOLq3 multifactors_securityHigh__kskjX">High<!-- --> Security</span></div><div class="multifactors_mfaTypeCard__D4t3X"><div class="multifactors_mfaIcon__sRc83">📱</div><h3>Authenticator Apps</h3><p>Google Authenticator, Authy, and Microsoft Authenticator generate time-based codes on your device.</p><span class="multifactors_mfaSecurityLevel__DOLq3 multifactors_securityHigh__kskjX">High<!-- --> Security</span></div><div class="multifactors_mfaTypeCard__D4t3X"><div class="multifactors_mfaIcon__sRc83">👆</div><h3>Biometric Verification</h3><p>Uses unique physical traits like fingerprints (Touch ID), facial recognition (Face ID), or iris scans.</p><span class="multifactors_mfaSecurityLevel__DOLq3 multifactors_securityHigh__kskjX">High<!-- --> Security</span></div><div class="multifactors_mfaTypeCard__D4t3X"><div class="multifactors_mfaIcon__sRc83">📲</div><h3>Push Notifications</h3><p>Services like Duo send login approval requests directly to your smartphone for seamless authentication.</p><span class="multifactors_mfaSecurityLevel__DOLq3 multifactors_securityMedium__XnseM">Medium<!-- --> Security</span></div><div class="multifactors_mfaTypeCard__D4t3X"><div class="multifactors_mfaIcon__sRc83">📧</div><h3>Email-based Codes</h3><p>One-time codes sent to your registered email address as a secondary verification method.</p><span class="multifactors_mfaSecurityLevel__DOLq3 multifactors_securityMedium__XnseM">Medium<!-- --> Security</span></div><div class="multifactors_mfaTypeCard__D4t3X"><div class="multifactors_mfaIcon__sRc83">💬</div><h3>SMS Text Codes</h3><p>Codes sent via text message - convenient but vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks.</p><span class="multifactors_mfaSecurityLevel__DOLq3 multifactors_securityLow__2eCjE">Low<!-- --> Security</span></div><div class="multifactors_mfaTypeCard__D4t3X"><div class="multifactors_mfaIcon__sRc83">📄</div><h3>Backup Codes</h3><p>Single-use static codes for account recovery when you lose access to your primary MFA method.</p><span class="multifactors_mfaSecurityLevel__DOLq3 multifactors_securityMedium__XnseM">Medium<!-- --> Security</span></div><div class="multifactors_mfaTypeCard__D4t3X"><div class="multifactors_mfaIcon__sRc83">💻</div><h3>Software Tokens</h3><p>Desktop applications that generate time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) for computer-based authentication.</p><span class="multifactors_mfaSecurityLevel__DOLq3 multifactors_securityMedium__XnseM">Medium<!-- --> Security</span></div></div></section><section class="multifactors_securitySection__LGveN"><div class="multifactors_sectionHeader__UHBKK"><h2>MFA Security Hierarchy</h2><p class="multifactors_sectionSubtitle__CVfdg">Understanding the relative security of different authentication methods</p></div><div class="multifactors_securityHierarchy__9o4SX"><div class="multifactors_securityLevel__NVrMj"><div class="multifactors_securityRank__STCTe">1</div><div class="multifactors_securityContent__OrDQL"><h3>Hardware Security Keys (Most Secure)</h3><p>Physical devices like YubiKey use public-key cryptography (FIDO2/WebAuthn standards) to prove your identity.
