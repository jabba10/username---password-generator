Built on FIDO2 and WebAuthn standards, a passkey consists of a mathematically linked pair of cryptographic keys: a public key stored by the website or app and a private key that remains securely stored on your personal devices, such as your phone or laptop. When you log in, the service sends a challenge that your device signs with your private key, which is only unlocked using your biometrics or PIN. This process is not only more secure—eliminating risks like phishing, credential stuffing, and password database breaches—but also incredibly user-friendly. There are no complex strings to remember, type, or manage. Your face or fingerprint is the key. While passkeys are still in the early stages of adoption, they are quickly being integrated into major platforms and services, promising a future where logging in is as simple as a glance or a touch, making our digital lives both safer and smoother.'}),(0,a.jsx)("h3",{children:"How Passkeys Work"}),(0,a.jsx)("p",{children:"Instead of storing passwords on servers, your device generates a cryptographic key pair.

Your device, such as your smartphone or computer, generates a unique pair of cryptographic keys. The private key remains securely encrypted and stored exclusively on your device, never shared with anyone. The public key, which is useless on its own to an attacker, is sent to the website or service and stored in their database. When you later attempt to log in, the website sends a cryptographic challenge to your device. Your device must then use the corresponding private key to sign and solve this challenge. Access to the private key is protected by your device's own authentication method—this could be biometric verification like Face ID or Touch ID, or your device's PIN. This means that even if a hacker phishes a website or steals its database, they only get the public keys, which cannot be reverse-engineered to reveal your private key or used to log in elsewhere. This elegant system entirely bypasses the risks of weak, reused, or stolen passwords, offering a seamless and phishing-resistant login experience that is both simpler for users and far more secure for everyone."}),(0,a.jsx)("h3",{children:"Benefits"}),(0,a.jsxs)("ul",{children:[(0,a.jsx)("li",{children:"No more forgotten passwords"}),(0,a.jsx)("li",{children:"Immune to phishing"}),(0,a.jsx)("li",{children:"Faster and more secure login"}),(0,a.jsx)("li",{children:"Eliminates the risk of password database breaches"}),(0,a.jsx)("li",{children:"Simplified login across your synchronized devices"}),(0,a.jsx)("li",{children:"Reduces reliance on insecure SMS or email codes"}),(0,a.jsx)("li",{children:"Backed by major tech companies for widespread compatibility"})]}),(0,a.jsx)("p",{children:"Passkeys provide a seamless and future-proof authentication experience, combining top-tier security with unmatched convenience.
